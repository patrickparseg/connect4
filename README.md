# connect4
This is my final project for Advanced C++. I created a Connect 4 Game with multiple unique features.
This game includes an explosion feature which randomly clears a full column on the board once per game. 

Some of the Concepts Used:

    	-Object Oriented Programming Techniques
		-Exception Handling
		-Recursive Function
		-Composition
		-2D Array
